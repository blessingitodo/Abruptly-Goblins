# **Abruptly Goblins**

Sorcery Society is a comic book game store who have diversified their shop offerings to include miniatures, plush toys, collectible card games, and board games.  Eventually, the store became more a games store with a selection of this week's newest comic books and a small offering of graphic novel paperbacks. The gamers' favorite RPG is "Abruptly Goblins!" and they will happily pay you per chair to secure the space to do it. 

This project writes a code that automates a game night selector for the store to select the best game night. The goal is to send out emails to the gamers who will be available on the best game night and second best game night.
